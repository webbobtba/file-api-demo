What is the File System Access API?

The File System Access API (formerly known as Native File System API and prior to that it was called Writeable Files API) enables developers to build powerful web apps that interact with files on the user's local device, like IDEs, photo and video editors, text editors, and more. After a user grants a web app access, this API allows them to read or save changes directly to files and folders on the user's device. Beyond reading and writing files, the File System Access API provides the ability to open a directory and enumerate its contents.

If you've worked with reading and writing files before, much of what I'm about to share will be familiar to you. I encourage you to read it anyway, because not all systems are alike.
